# Hi there!
My name's Bal√°zs, and I'm a Transylvanian software developer.
I'm interested in all kinds of things, but mainly computer science and photography.
My friends are Python and JavaScript, but I'm also on good terms with C, SQL,
and other back-, or front end stuff that help me design and realize
software from start to finish.
