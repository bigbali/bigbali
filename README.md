Hello. My name is Balázs Burján, and I am eager to learn and create stuff.
My interests lie mostly in computer science and photography.
I have fallen in love with Python, as I tend to use Django for every web based project, though I also have used Flask in the past for the same purpose.
I also enjoy frontend stuff, which means HTML, SCSS and JS, as even React has found its way to me.
The language C is also my dear friend, and so is SQL, though I tend to forsake our friendship from time to time.
